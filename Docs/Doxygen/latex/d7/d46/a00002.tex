\section*{Aiki }

The connecting scripting language Aiki. The scripting language was a school project but turned into~\newline
 a hobby exercise for compiler development. In the foreseeable future it will not be applicable on all ~\newline
 grounds in other terms of real world application, it was just a fun project.~\newline
~\newline
 Aiki aimed to be integrated easily with C++. The syntax is similar to that from Java. Unlike the language Java the Aiki is developed with ease of use from the command line while also utilizing precompiled binaries.

~\newline
 ~\newline
 \subsection*{Portability  Aiki will run on a several of platforms eventually. But for now it is only tested on Windows \& Linux. ~\newline
 It will probably work without and trouble on O\+S X. ~\newline
